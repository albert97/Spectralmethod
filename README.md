# Spectralmethod
The script is inspired by Lloyd N. Trefethen's book Spectral Methods in Matlab 

This script has to be run with Eigen Library, at the time of writing, it was eign-3.3.8 I used
One dimensional Spectral method using Chebyshev Points
Main function is cheb,cpp which generates the chebyshev point.
make_che shouls run the te excuatbales, generate the plot file and plot the file using gnuplot
Two plots files are given as examples:
smoothfunc.dat is generated using spectral method while smoothfuncExactSol.dat is the exact solution for comparision
